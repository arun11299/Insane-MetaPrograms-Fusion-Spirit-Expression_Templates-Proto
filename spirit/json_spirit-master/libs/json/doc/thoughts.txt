----------------
Not Header-only :

Most methods in the ciere::json library do not require client
usage signatures that are determined at compile time. As such,
a choice must be made about "header-only" simply for the sake
of header-only. The trade off is understanding your build
system and the need to link versus reocurring compile time
penalties. The use of Spirit for the parser and othe 
template meta-programming techniques results in longish
compile times. The author strongly believes that header-only
libraries simply because people don't know how to use linkers
anymore isnt a good price to pay.

Within the normal usage patterns the library should only
need to be built once and can then simply be linked. If
the streams or iterators you work with fall outside of
the normal pre-compiled versions then an additional
declaration may be required. Please see the compile
and linking section for details on how to achieve optimal
flexibility and reduced compile times with the ciere::json
library.
